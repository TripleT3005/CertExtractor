**CertExtractor** is a small Windows tool that helps you extract digital certificates from files – easily, quickly, and with no fuss.

Just drag in a file or folder, and CertExtractor will find and save all embedded X.509 certificates – including full certificate chains. No command-line magic needed.

3. Select files or a folder using the buttons – or just drag & drop.
4. The extraction starts automatically.
